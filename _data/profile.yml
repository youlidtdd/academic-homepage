    Welcome! I am a 1-year Ph.D. candidate in the Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering at Texas Tech University. 
    Currently, I work in the SLEEP (Statistically Enhanced Privacy) Group, where My research focuses on the cutting-edge intersection of 
    privacy-preserving technologies and generative AI. I am dedicated to enhancing generative models through innovative differential 
    privacy mechanisms, aiming to resolve the critical trade-off between privacy leakage risks and data utility in the context of 
    high-dimensional, complex data.
